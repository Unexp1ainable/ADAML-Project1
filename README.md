Mining Process Level A3

--add project description-- #

Notes: 
  - Week 4 and 6 will be heavy
  - after every week, done tasks will be deleted 

Weekly to do's: 
Week 4: Create modelling plan 
  - modelling goal (What's our task/purpose?)
  - model calibration strategy: used tools, methodology and data
  - model validation strategy: scope of validation, methodology
  - model testing strategy: metrics and data used
  - description of the mathematical methods used in modeling
  - model diagram/ operations flowchart (if more than one modelling goal: multiple paths in flowchart) 
  - role group members in modelling
  - document appearance: readability, figures and caputures, clarity and completness

Week 5: Give feedback to other models 
  Possible feedback options: 
    - pointing out mistakes
    - point out confusing things, we don't understand 
    - maybe improvements to the methodology
    - point out alternative ways 

Week 6: Initial model results 
  (we get some extra points because  our task is more difficult) 
  - incorporate feedback of week 5
  - code (correct, efficient and usable)
  - reporting (readable, complete and presentable; maybe we need to do a presentation)
  - modelling correctness (use testing parameters like accuracy, ...)
  - achieving the modelling goal

Week 7: Give other groups feedback 
  - suggest on how to improve the report content
  - suggestions on how to improve the model
  - general comments on the results and the code
  - a question for the other team

Week 8: 
  (we get extra points again for difficulty) 
  - incorporate feedback and response to commenting team
  - improve code (also look for accesability and the features of week 6)
  - reporting
  - modelling correctness
  - achieving the modelling goal

Learning objectives:
  - to transform raw data into meaningful, useful knowledge on a real world process or phenomena;
  - to manage group work, divide tasks and collaborate on a data analysis project;
  - to be able to define roles in a group and to agree on decisions;
  - to give, evaluate and incorporate feedback;
  - to efficiently report results of a data analysis.
